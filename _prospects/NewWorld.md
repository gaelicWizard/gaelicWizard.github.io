Throughout my career, I have contributed to impacting business outcomes through effective organization, prioritization, and execution of key projects. My skills and qualifications are an ideal match to the {{ page.title }} requirements and will bring immediate value to {{ page.company }} goals.

Previously, in my Senior Systems Engineer role, I exercised a calculated and methodical approach to problem solving. I am independently motivated, yet I appreciate team efforts and collaborate productively within groups. I am knowledgeable in network architecture, server provisioning, and desktop management with proficiency in deployment and continuing management and maintenance.

Because my professional goals align with {{ page.company }}'s mission and values, this opportunity is especially exciting. I believe my critical thinking, collaboration, and customer service abilities will support and drive your continued organizational success.

Since July 2021, I elected to pursue a short sabbatical. With full disclosure to my employer, I embarked on a personal mission to enhance my professional experience and knowledge base. I would be open to elaborate more if you have further questions!
