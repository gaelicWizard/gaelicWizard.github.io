After speaking with Keith from Insight Global this morning, I'm even more interested in the {{ page.title }} role. This position is *right up my ally*. For the past eight years, I have been the head system administrator or "virtual CTO" for over a dozen small medical facilities. My pursuit has been for modern information systems, integrated across departments and between vendors, by leveraging Microsoft technologies on-prem and in the cloud. My work has been primarily technical, while also interfacing with the business owners for high-level decisions, information transfer, and budget planning.

I have long espoused the principle that identity is the core of information services and, most importantly, of information security, and for the past 8 years I have led a small team to design, implement, deliver, and maintain Active Directory fully managed on-premises with Group Policy and then expanded through Azure AD, Office 365, and Microsoft Endpoint Manager to achieve a hybrid work environment leveraging the best of both worlds. We assembled and integrated "soup to nuts" IT stacks with integrity, confidentiality, and availability as core architectural pilars in the highly-regulated healthcare industry. Some recent projects include:
- Greenfield Azure AD, Office 365, & Microsoft Endpoint Manager Intune implemntation for a four-facility 150-employee pulmonary medical group over the course of a six month gradual implementation and transition window, without interrupting business operations.
- Incremental upgrade and migration from on-premises-only Active Directory with Exchange to Hybrid AD+AAD with Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Microsoft Teams for a five-facility 250-employee cardiology medical group over the course of two years, without disrupting business operations, while delivering incremental improvements at each step of the way.
- Complete rebuild and replacement of aging on-premises Active Directory with Hybrid AD+AAD and Microsoft 365 including Office 365 services as well as mobile device management, no-VPN remote radiology workstations using Azure Application Proxy, and extensive Teams adoption including Microsoft Teams Voice integration with external telephony provider for a three-facility 200-employee radiology medical group.

In all these examples, we delivered integrated Single Sign-On for Microsoft *and* third-party applications, leveraging Kerberos and WIA running on-premises, as well as SAML through Azure AD for internal and external services, including GE Healthcare Advantage Workstation (PET/CT imaging), GE Healthcare PACS-IW (radiology imaging), Ambra Health (formerly DICOM Grid), and Google Workspace. I believe that information systems can only be as secure as the people who use them, so maximizing each staff member's utility and reducing their experience of friction is a core tenant of my IT philosophy.

I have lived and breathed information technology for over twenty years, with the past eight being specifically with Microsoft products, technologies, and services in the healthcare vertical.
