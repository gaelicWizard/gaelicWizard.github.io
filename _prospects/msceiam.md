The challenges of raising a family while delivering unmatched customer service *and* operating the business has taught me several valuable lessons, not least of which is that my employees should be positioned where they can excel and shielded from distraction and interference. Upon deciding that one of these commitments needed to go, I was thrilled to find the post on LinkedIn for {{ page.title }}. The opportunity to continue to deliver first-class integrated Microsoft-based solutions, without the cost to my family that came with owning a business, is simply too exciting to pass up!

I have long espoused the principle that identity is the core of information services and, most importantly, of information security, and for the past 8 years I have advocated, architected, and applied Microsoft technologies and systems in over a dozen environments from tiny to SME. From Active Directory to Azure AD and Microsoft 365, I have assembled and integrated "soup to nuts" IT stacks with integrity, confidentiality, and availability as core architectural pilars in the highly-regulated healthcare industry. Some recent projects include:
- Greenfield Azure AD, Office 365, & Microsoft Endpoint Manager Intune implemntation for a four-facility 150-employee pulmonary medical group over the course of a six month gradual implementation and transition window, without interrupting business operations.
- Incremental upgrade and migration from on-premises-only Active Directory with Exchange to Hybrid AD+AAD with Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Microsoft Teams for a five-facility 250-employee cardiology medical group over the course of two years, without disrupting business operations, while delivering incremental improvements at each step of the way.
- Complete rebuild and replacement of aging on-premises Active Directory with Hybrid AD+AAD and Microsoft 365 including Office 365 services as well as mobile device management, no-VPN remote medical workstations using Azure Application Proxy, and extensive Teams adoption including Microsoft Teams Voice integration with external telephony provider for a three-facility 200-employee radiology medical group.

I have lived and breathed information technology for over twenty years, with the past eight being specifically with Microsoft products, technologies, and services. I can't think of a better opportunity than to be able to deliver not only best-in-class technologies, but to be able to do so directly with the customers looking to Microsoft to design and support their architecture for maximum value.
