Throughout my career, I have contributed to impacting business outcomes through effective organization, prioritization, and execution of key projects. My skills and qualifications are an ideal match to the Imaging Application Administrator II requirements and will bring immediate value to Kaiser Permanente goals.

Previously, in my Senior Systems Engineer role, I exercised a calculated and methodical approach to problem solving. I am independently motivated, yet I appreciate team efforts and collaborate productively within groups. I am knowledgeable in PACS andministration with Fuji Synapse, GE PACS-IW, Sectra IDS7, and custom solutions built on dcm4chee, and desktop management with proficiency in deployment and support for ever-changing base images.
Because my professional goals align with Kaiser Permanente's mission and values, this opportunity is especially exciting. I believe my critical thinking, collaboration and customer service abilities will support and drive your continued organizational success.

Since July 2021, I elected to pursue a short sabbatical. With full disclosure to my employer, I embarked on a personal mission to enhance my professional experience and knowledge base. I would be open to elaborate more if you have further questions!
