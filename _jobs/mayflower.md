As founder and principal of Mayflower Information Services & Technology, I collected requirements, designed solutions, and implemented deliverables at every layer of the IT stack for small medical practices in radiology and cardiology. Along with my team of two engineers, we supported and deployed Active Directory with Windows Hello, Azure AD with MFA and cloud password protection, Office 365, Mobile Device Management (Intune) for iOS and Mac, Remote Desktop Services for external access when necessary and Azure Application Proxy when possible, Google Workspace with SSO through Azure AD SAML, Hyper-V clusters with shared and converged storage, 3rd party application servers, Exchange Hybrid and Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business to replace Windows Roaming Profiles, Microsoft Teams, and more. We als√∂ leveraged Azure Log Analytics solutions for Desktop Analytics and Update Readiness, and were beginning Azure Sentinel.
